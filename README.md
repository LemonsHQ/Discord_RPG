Discord bot that allows users to do things typical in RPG games such as fighting, training and leveling up.

The game has 3 stats that you can train with stamina which you gain every 5 minutes. Power gives you more damage, speed allows you to get more hits in, and strength gives you more defense while also adding a little bit more damage. 

As you level up, your health increases and you get an increase in stats each time you train.
